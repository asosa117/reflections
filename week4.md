As a Senior CS student looking for jobs I have noticed the job market in tech is becoming more and more difficult. I wanted to find a graph that visualized how the country's job market
is handling itself and which fields are good and bad to work in.

This visualization is an interesting combination of images, graphs and colors that make a visually appealing display for viewers. There are two different graphs in this visualization,
a bar graph and a bubble graph that has the ability to display both positive and negative numbers. The graphs have small widgets and labels to show what is being graphed without confusion
and displays the numbers in bold lettering for viewers to also locate and digest the information easily. There are also small descriptions/explainations about why a number is high or why
it is low which I like because it gives you a perspective for not only that specific job field they're talking about but also for the rest. The use of colors is also interesting because it
differs from the usual colors of green and red for good and bad. Here they use bluish and orangish colors to indicate they postive and negtive trends that allows the viewer to grasp the 
information at the blink of an eye.

The way the data was displayed is great and easy to read but I do wish they could have added more job fields and turn the bar graph into a different visualization that shows
more data. I do like that these two visualizations have a starting line that begins at 0 and allows the data to be displayed for both postive and negative numbers by
placing the data one left side of the line for decline and right side of the line for growth. Overall this is a great visualization and sadly confirms my worries about the tech job market.
